- Excludes Step 3 topics
- Includes Step 4 goals
- Smart limiting based on goal count
- Better keyword matching

### **Content Generation & Caching**
**Status:** ‚úÖ **OPTIMIZED**

**Flow:**
- Step 4: Generate dynamic cards ‚Üí Send to backend ‚Üí AI generates content ‚Üí Cache in DB
- Dashboard: Load from cache ‚Üí Display cards
- Regenerate: Optional manual refresh

- `frontend/components/voice/DashboardVoiceAgent.tsx` - Voice agent with tooltip
- `frontend/lib/constants.ts` - Smart card generation logic
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete architecture documentation
- `README.md` - User-facing documentation

**Documentation Files:**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system architecture
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup
- `myPlanning.md` - This file

## üìù **Key Insights:**

### Smart Card Generation
- Cards must be generated in Step 4 and passed to backend
- Frontend `constants.ts` handles all card selection logic
- Backend `ai.js` generates content based on card list
- Intelligent filtering ensures relevance

### Voice Agent
- Context injection is critical for quality responses
- Dashboard data must be auto-injected on every message
- Some stability issues are OpenAI Realtime API limitations
- Tooltip UX improvement works well

### Content Caching
- Generate once, cache in DB, load from cache
- Reduces API calls and costs
- Faster dashboard loading
- Regenerate option for flexibility
